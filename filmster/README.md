[Teachers' Project Briefs](https://docs.google.com/a/devbootcamp.com/document/d/1Kmw125hcNvyA_v4e35__TADi5NP88ELdhVfzPSlyAIc/edit?usp=sharing)

*Film Review Site*

A site where trusted reviewers can write reviews about films, other users can rate the reviews and talk about the reviews and the films.

Key features:
has users and authentication, some of whom are “trusted reviewers”
has a public list of films
each film has some reviews written only by trusted reviewers
films belong to categories
should be able to see the latest reviews, and the latest reviews by category
users should be able to rate and comment on reviews
users should be able to rate and comment on films

Stretch ideas:
admin access for reviewers on comments left on their reviews
actors in films, and reviews for actors

### Learning Competencies

- Interfacing with clients to determine the specification for building an application, in the form of user stories.
- Using a formal Agile group process to complete a successful development project.

### Summary

Let's put all of our knowledge thus far to the test and build someone a real web application!

The goal is for this challenge to simulate (albeit in a compressed form) the process of interacting with clients, building prototypes for them, and iterating based upon their feedback - all while working together as a team and following development and deployment best practices.

Your instructors will act as your clients throughout this project, helping you drive discovery of their requirements. The instructors will not be "difficult clients" - their goal is to help you find the right questions to ask and will respond as such. This is a low-stakes environment to practice these vital skills.

While you may have the temptation to try to throw a lot of AJAX into this application or turn it into a "single-page application," resist this temptation. There will be plenty of time for exploring JavaScript features later. Focus on defining clear routes, creating clean templates, and testing a "classic" CGI application.

Use the "DBC Rails"-preferred stack:

- Practice TDD using RSpec with `factory_girl` and `capybara`
- [Remove `turbolinks`][die-turbolinks] and `coffee-rails`

Remember, to create a new Rails application with certain features enabled / disabled, you can use [command-line switches][cls].  A good start would be `rails --help`.

### Strategy

Before you dive to deeply into the code, be clear with your team on three things:

1. Decide on your MVP
2. Break your MVP down into deliverable features

### Testing

Your app must be fully tested.  If you want to stretch yourself by TDDing your way, go for it, but timebox yourself. The goal of this is to actually build a functional and well tested app.

Additionally, since testing is such a heavy focus for this application, you should integrate [Continuous Integration][CI].  Two popular providers of CI services are [TravisCI][] and [CircleCI][].

As a bonus feature, try integrating the callback hooks between CI and [Trello][] and [Slack][] to post your CI status directly into your cards and chat..

### Pro Developer Technologies

* Track your work and user stories and their progress by means of [Trello][], [Pivotal Tracker][] or a physical card wall.
* Add continuous integration (CI) to your repo.
* Keep your team communication up and add a chat application.  Many teams, especially those that work remotely, find it helpful to use a chat environment like Slack.  Integrate this with GitHub and CI and hygeinic git behavior, you can work as well separated by miles as you might while standing in the same room together.

### Checkpoints

* Your team should produce a repo inside of your cohort's organization in GitHub
* Your first commit should be a `README.md` containing:
 * Your team name
 * Your team members' names
 * The user stories that define your MVP
* You will be demoing your MVP
 * Show us your app doing the essential work of your app
 * Show us your tests
 * Show us `git log --graph`, this should be clean
* You will be demoing your final project
